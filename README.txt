Welcome to John Polus's Chess Game repository!

This is a chess program that I initially wrote in my first year of college at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. It is written in Java using Swing components for the GUI. I used the Netbeans IDE for development, largely because it is free for anyone to use.

This chess game has helped me to learn about a lot of new concepts, starting with recursion way back when I started it, to different algorithms and heuristics, to different ideas for UI designs. It was even used for a Software Maintenance class project, principally because of its lack of quality code and documentation. Later that semester, I also used this for an Artificial Intelligence project, exploring the idea of solving for checkmate.
