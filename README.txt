Welcome to John Polus's Chess Game repository!

This is a chess program that I wrote in my first year of college at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. It is written in Java using Java Swing components for the GUI. It is not exemplary in terms of design choices, so don't emulate everything you see in the source code. I used the Netbeans IDE for working on this and I uploaded the project files here so you can download and open it right up.

This chess game has helped me to learn about a lot of new concepts, starting with recursion way back when I started it, to different algorithms and heuristics, to different ideas for UI designs. It was used this Spring as the subject of a Software Maintenance class project, principally because of its lack of quality code and documentation. So, some of the changes you see were made by classmates and not me (shoutout to Adam Larson, Ryan Kassell, Seth Surendonk and Mitchell Harter (commit a9c0862013b629704db3120d165b6caf468d9390)). Later that semester, I also modified this for an Artificial Intelligence project, adding in the ability to solve for checkmate.
