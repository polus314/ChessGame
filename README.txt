Welcome to John Polus's Chess Game repository!

This is a chess game that I wrote in my freshman year of college at the University of Wisconsin-Platteville. It is written in Java using Java Swing components for the GUI. It is not exemplary in terms of design choices, so don't emulate everything you see in the source code. Also, I used the Netbeans IDE for working on this and I have the project files here as well, so you can download and open it right up.

This chess game has always been more about learning and trying new ideas than becoming something that I would sell or otherwise distribute. It was used this Spring as the subject of a Software Maintenance class project, principally because of its lack of quality code and documentation. So, some of the changes you see were made by classmates and not me (shoutout to Adam Larson, Ryan Kassell, Seth Surendonk and Mitchell Harter).
